# IT3600Final

### This final project is a Cognitive Walkthrough Simulation. 

##### In this project, we will simulate the cognitive process of users navigating a chosen digital product, identify usability barriers and cognitive challenges encountered during interaction with the exisiting UI, and propose design modifications to enhance the product's usability and user satisfaction. 

##### This project is split into 4 distinct phases. The first is Product Selection and Preparation, followed by Cognitive Walkthrough Execution, then Issue Identification and Analysis, and finally Design Recommendations and Prototyping. 

##### Firstly, this project will focus on Netflix's user inteface, specifically the app's main landing page. As opposed to the user interface associated with playing, stopping, and adjusting settings relating to the content itself, this project focuses on the user interface associated with user's navigating and exploring the product's extensive library and selecting media.
