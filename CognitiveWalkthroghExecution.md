# Cognitive Walkthrough Execution

### Sign-in User Flow

###### When users begin the sign-in process, they are greeted with a pretty standard login flow.

###### Accounts are created with supplying a valid email and password combination.

###### Users choose a subscription plan and after supplying payment credentials, are then prompted to select shows and movies they are interested in.

###### To simplify the already lengthy process of creating an account, selecting a plan, providing payment credentials, etc., the cognitive load placed on users should be simplfied to provide users familiar with the platform and thus, know why they're on the application, a method to bypass this unneccesary step. Especially when we consider Netflix is by far the largest streaming service provier, with over 300,000,000 registered accounts, so users will likely be familiar with content options and don't want to immediately set up content recommendations when trying to access media. Notice in the above image, there is no way to bypass inputting content selections. Instead of locking the user into a recommendation feature, users should have the ability to choose whether to fully customize their account now, or if they'd like to jump into the app's library.

###### In the current app flow, users then have to select their default profile upon creating their account. Although selecting a profile makes sense when there are other users that exist in the application, many of these steps could be stored elsewhere. For example, creating additional viewing profiles and configuring recommendation features could be stored under the user's profile settings for easy access when they want to spend the time doing so. Adding all these extra steps only adds to user's cognitive load.

###### We see, upon exploring the UI, that content options are placed into uniformly sized rectangular blocks. There only real organization inherent to the application's interface are headers seperating each collection from one another. Categories can range from anything such as "Trending recently", to "Comedies", to "Binge-worthy", to "Recommended for you". There is quite a bit of variability that appears when users go to actually look for content they are interested in watching. Action required here is users are tasked with using their directional buttons (left, right, up, down) to navigate amongst the entire collection of Netflix's media collection in order to search for shows they may be interested in. If users know the exact content name they are looking for, they must navigate over to the left of the screen, hit a magnifying glass icon, then enter, letter by letter, the name of the content they are looking for. After finding the content they wish to view, they click on the content once, then again on the 'Play now', button to begin viewing content.
