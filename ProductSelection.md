# Product Selection and Preparation

### Product Selection

###### As discussed in the README.md, we will be focusing on Netflix's UI & UX for this project. Specifically, we will be focusing on the user interface pertaining to a user choosing media from the product's vast library once signed into the application. This project will not focus on the UI & UX of interacting with the chosen media itself, such as considering or modifying the manner in which content is resumed, paused, captioned, or otherwise adjusted via settings. Navigating the app's content library and selecting a piece of media is the focus of this project in order to properly define a clear and concise scope. 


### Product Features 

###### Netflix offers unlimited access to a wide library of movies and TV shows, the ability to download such content onto a local device, personalized profiles with unique recommendations. At it's core, users use the app to explore and chose media from the vast library. Users expect a functioning platform that allows them to easily sign-in, explore and find media to consume, and a simplistic user interface for viewing said content. The primary target demographic for Netflix's services, according to businessmodelanalyst.com, are indiviuals aged 18 to 39. This demographic is likely a target for the media giant because this demographic is generally tech-savvy and enjoy streaming new-form content. Driven by a desire to seek out on-demand content, flexibility in viewing options, and inclination towards subscription based models, this is the target demographic this project identifies as our core user base.
