# Design Recommendations and Prototyping

### Recommendations
- Layered Content Organization with Example
    - Continue Watching > content cards here
    - Movies > Action & Adventure, Drama, Comedy, Trending > movies here under each category
    -  TV > Action & Adventure, Drama, Comedy, Trending > shows here under each category
- Easier Search Feature
    - Autocomplete word options for searching strings similar to PS5 keyboard implementation 
    - Smart TV microphone utilization
- Reduce UI "Noise"
    - Remove autoplay video / audio content when focusing on content cards to allow user to view trailer if desired, but not overwhelm them with undesired and distracting content
    - Better organization and display of content cards in order to reduce cognitive load on user and prevent "choice paralysis" 



### Prototypes

##### This prototype roughly demonstrates how users could visualize more organized, coherent UI for media selection. As opposed to the current user interface which has a grid of all available media at the same size, this allows users to filter the content selection down by choosing broad media categories, then subcategories within that main cateogry, and finally see content cards pertaining to the specific category they are interested in, reducing visual load. These content cards would scale dynamically as the user enters specific categories, eliminating undesired content cards from appearing and making better use of the user interface.

##### The below image shows how the UI could dynamically scale to limit content cards displayed as user select specific categories they are interested in. In this instance, the user was presented with the screen shown above, then tabbed to 'TV & Shows' to 'Drama' and can now access the content they are interested with their selections mirrored on the screen, decreasing cognitive load from undesired content cards.

##### Finally, below is an example of how the 'Smart Keyboard' would work, with autocomplete suggestions based on currently typed text, decreasing the workload placed on the user to complete popular tasks.
